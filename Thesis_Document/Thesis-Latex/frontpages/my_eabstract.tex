In this research, we focus on abstracting the "Gameplay Patterns" in the games. Using the "Procedural Content Generation" to generate the meaningful game levels. Improve the players' experience when they are in gameplay, then provide the a total solution for generating completed game levels.

We merge and modify two approaches that are "Mission/Space framework" and "Multi-segment Evolution". The first one keeps the sequence of game progressing, and the second one gives the stable and various content of game. Wish that can enhance the players' overall experience. Game levels are divided to two structures that are Missions and Spaces. Missions convert into a meaningful space isomorphically and follow the gameplay patterns to define the fitness functions of Genetic Algorithms. The spaces are based on the GA to evolve the fittest layout of game objects.

Reduce the costs of design the level effectively and manage all elements in games via using this solution of level generation. In the same time, keep the players can follow the stories that designed by game designers and enjoy in the meaningful and various content of game.
